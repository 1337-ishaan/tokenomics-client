Who are your competitors? What do you understand about your business that they don't?
What sets us apart is our deep integration of AI, which not only automates the creation process but also provides real-time simulations and tailored recommendations. Unlike many competitors who offer one-size-fits-all solutions or require extensive manual input, we focus on making tokenomics creation accessible to everyone, from beginners to experts, with a streamlined, user-friendly platform. We understand the need for simplicity, efficiency, and customization in this space, which many competitors may overlook.


How do or will you make money? How much could you make?
(We realize you can't know precisely, but give your best estimate)



In terms of potential revenue, based on market research and similar platforms, we estimate that with a user base of 10,000 subscribers at an average of $50 per month, we could generate $6 million annually. As the Web3 space continues to grow, there's significant potential for scaling and increasing revenue over time.

This may be in the US, in your home country or in another country.

What convinced you to apply to Y Combinator? Did someone encourage you to apply? Have you been to any YC events?
We were encouraged to apply after speaking with several successful YC alumni who shared their positive experiences and the significant impact the program had on their ventures. While we havenâ€™t attended any YC events personally, we've followed the program closely and have been inspired by the success stories and the support YC provides to startups.
